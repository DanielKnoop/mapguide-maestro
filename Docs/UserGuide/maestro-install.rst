Installing MapGuide Maestro
---------------------------

You can always download the latest version of Maestro from the `download page <http://trac.osgeo.org/mapguide/wiki/maestro/Downloads>`_. If you are a Windows user, you can just download the MSI package and double click it. All the questions have qualified defaults, and you may safely press "next" on all of them.

If you dislike the MSI (or are on Linux), you can use the binaries. The MapGuide Maestro installation is merely a file copy operation, so you may safely move the installation folder around.

You can also run the binaries from a USB key if you like. Due to some security restrictions in .Net on Windows, you may not be able to run MapGuide Maestro from a network folder.

Yes, MapGuide Maestro installation is THAT easy! (If you are on linux, see the instructions for Mono installation on the `download page <http://trac.osgeo.org/mapguide/wiki/maestro/Downloads>`_).

Usually MapGuide Maestro has development between releases, and you can download a preview release at any time from the `download page <http://trac.osgeo.org/mapguide/wiki/maestro/Downloads>`_. If you do not want to mess with your regular MapGuide Maestro installation, you can download the binaries and run them from a seperate folder. Preview releases are generally safe to use, but may not be worth the time it takes to upgrade, and may contain incomplete features.
