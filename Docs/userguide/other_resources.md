# Other Resources

It is hoped that this user guide has given you enough information to get comfortable in authoring data in Maestro.

However, should you have any questions or require more information, there are many online resources to help.

 * [The Maestro wiki](http://trac.osgeo.org/mapguide/wiki/maestro)
 * [The mapguide-users mailing list](http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/mapguide-users). User discussion of all things mapguide related. A [Nabble](http://www.nabble.com) front-end exists too, but you must be registered on the mailing lists for your Nabble posts to properly make it back to the mailing lists
 * [The author's blog](http://themapguyde.blogspot.com>). Contains lots of Maestro, MapGuide and FDO tips and tricks.

If you do find bugs or have an idea for a product enhancement, please do not hesistate to [file an issue](https://github.com/jumpinjackie/mapguide-maestro/issues)
