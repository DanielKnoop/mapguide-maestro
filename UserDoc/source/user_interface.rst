==========================

The main Maestro application window is composed of the following components:

The **Site Explorer** presents the visual view of your MapGuide Server **Site Repository**, showing all the folders and resources stored within. 
When you double click a resource in the Site Explorer, it will open the matching editor for that particular resource. If the resource is not known to Maestro or the
version of the resource is not known to Maestro the XML Editor will be shown instead loaded with the XML content of the selected resource. When you right click a 
resource in the Site Explorer a whole assortment of options on the context menu is available for that selected resource.

All **Open Resources** will be shown in the main area of the Maestro application window.

Maestro is designed to be as transparent as possible to the user, as such it logs a lot of messages useful for diagnostic purposes. Maestro also logs most communication
that it makes to the MapGuide Server. You can see these logged messages and requests in the **Messages and Outbound Requests** tabs.
