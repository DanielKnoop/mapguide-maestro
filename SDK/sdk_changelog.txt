- New Desktop Samples
    - StandaloneWebLayoutEditor

- General Notes:
    - The Topology.dll reference has been replaced with NetTopologySuite.Merged.dll. If you reference this assembly, you
      will need to update some namespace imports (anything under the Topology namespace will have to be changed). Visual Studio
      can assist with updating namespace references.
