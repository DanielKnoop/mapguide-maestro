Mono Gotchas
============

This document is a compilation of known gotchas when using Maestro within a Mono environment

Suggestions for code-based workarounds or alternatives would be much appreciated.

Notes are based on running the current Maestro trunk against Mono 3.12 on Ubuntu 14.04 (from Xamarin's repo)

General
=======

 - Where possible, run the latest and greatest version of Mono.
 - Maestro may randomly core dump on startup. Workaround is just to restart again.
 - Editors may be "shrunk" when opened when Maestro is not fully maximized. Workaround is to resize the Maestro main window or maximize it.

Layer Editor
============

 - Style rule previews do not render. Either Mono's DataGridView cannot support image-based cells or the Image property of our rule models do not bind properly to image-based cells

Map Editor
==========

 - You cannot batch edit multiple groups and layers. Mono's PropertyGrid does not properly handle editing properties multiple selected objects
